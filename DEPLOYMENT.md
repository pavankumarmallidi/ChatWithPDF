## How It Works

ChatWithPDF makes it easy to get answers and insights from your PDF documents, right from your browser. Here’s how it works:

1. **Upload Your PDF:**  
   Simply drag and drop your PDF file, or select it from your device.
2. **Instant Processing:**  
   The platform quickly reads your document, turning it into searchable text and understanding its structure.
3. **Ask Questions:**  
   You can chat with your PDF—just type your questions in plain English, like “What is the main topic of this document?” or “Summarize page 3.”
4. **Get Smart Answers:**  
   ChatWithPDF uses advanced AI to find the answers in your document and responds instantly, just like chatting with a real assistant.
5. **Works on Any Device:**  
   Whether you’re on your phone, tablet, or computer, the experience is smooth and easy to use.
6. **Stay Organized:**  
   You can review past documents, search through your files, and keep everything in one place.

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

This project has been optimized for Vercel deployment. All necessary configurations are in place.

### 📋 What's Already Configured

- ✅ **Vercel Config** - `vercel.json` with proper SPA routing
- ✅ **Build Optimization** - Production-ready build settings
- ✅ **Security** - Removed all hardcoded credentials
- ✅ **Dependencies** - Updated and vulnerability-free
- ✅ **Environment Setup** - Proper environment variable handling
- ✅ **PWA Support** - Web app manifest and favicon
- ✅ **Browser Compatibility** - Updated browserslist database

## 🔧 Environment Variables for Vercel

Set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

### Required Variables
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Optional Variables (for AI features)
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
VITE_AI_SERVICE_URL=your_ai_service_endpoint
```

## 📱 Deployment Steps

### Method 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect the framework (Vite)

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add the required Supabase variables
   - Deploy!

### Method 2: Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   vercel env add VITE_SUPABASE_URL
   vercel env add VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   ```

## 🔍 Build Information

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Node Version**: `>=18.0.0`
- **Framework**: Vite + React + TypeScript

## 🚦 Post-Deployment Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Site loads correctly
- [ ] Favicon appears in browser tab
- [ ] PWA manifest works (can install as app)
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] Supabase connection works
- [ ] All routes work (SPA routing)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Performance metrics in Vercel dashboard

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - Ensure variables are prefixed with `VITE_`
   - Redeploy after adding variables

2. **404 on Refresh**
   - `vercel.json` rewrites should handle this
   - Check if vercel.json is properly configured

3. **Build Failures**
   - Check Node.js version (needs >=18)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed

### Performance Optimization

The project is already optimized with:
- Code splitting
- Tree shaking
- Minification
- Gzip compression
- Static asset caching
